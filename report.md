# Proofs of the Algorithms

## Hand-over-Hand Algorithm

### Linearizability

For both *remove*, *insert* and *contains* operation, let us consider the moments when the locks are taken as linearization points.
\newline
As *pred* and *curr* are locked during the update phase, they cannot be removed or altered, and then remain reachable until the locks are released. Thus, the structure of the list is preserved and the sequential specification of the set is respected.

### Deadlock freedom

We remark that the locks are acquired in ascending order of the keys. Thus, the process with the highest item locked will be able to make progress, either by updating the nodes if it found the right ones, or by pursuing the traversal as none of the following nodes is locked.

## Optimistic Algorithm

### Linearizability

We can choose the moment when the nodes have been locked and validated as the linearization point for any operation.
Then, as in the hand over hand algorithm, the *pred* and *curr* nodes being protected during the update, and as they are valid before the update, no operation can be interfering during the update and thus, the consistency and the sequential specification of the set are not violated.

### Deadlock freedom

Any process is able to make progress during the wait-free traversal step. Then, if the nodes that where found couldn't be locked or validated, it means that another process is or has been able to make progress. Hence the deadlock freedom.
